# Course description 

Understand how cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols work in practice by examining the underlying technical  mechanisms such as cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, decentralized ledgers, distributed consensus, mining, and  incentive engineering. Explore the novel decentralized applications enabled by cryptocurrency such as smart contracts  and decentralized autonomous organizations. Gain practical expertise through challenging programming projects on cryptography,  blockchains, distributed consensus, Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

The required textbooks are available online for free:
