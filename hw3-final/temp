I want to build my personal bitcoin block explorer by using Chainstack and Modal.
The way I build it is:
1. Sync the full bitcoin blockchain information, and store the data on Modal Volume(so the Modal Volume served as database).
2. The way to sync the bitcoin blockchain is, write a dockerfile to run an app on Modalodal, 
it make RPC call to a Chainstack endpoint, which is: 
host = "bitcoin-mainnet.core.chainstack.com"
port = "443"
username = "focused-fermi"  
password = "unsaid-cleft-errant-ample-sister-garnet"
rpc_url = f"https://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/33c7e6e3370a6b6c4e4dcf41f2746c59"
remember to store the username and password on Modal Secrets.
3. Write sql, so that the user can get bitcoin data from my Modal Volume.

Below is some points to implement Modal:
1. using modal.App not Stub
2. using modal.Volume.from_name not Volume.persisted
3. integreate requirements.txt into dockerfile directly
4. use @app.function not @stub.function
5. use like:@app.function(
    name="...",
    volumes={"/data": volume},
    image=bitcoin_image,
    timeout=86400,
    keep_warm=1,                # Keep warm for faster restarts
    secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("bitcoin-rpcauth")]
)
